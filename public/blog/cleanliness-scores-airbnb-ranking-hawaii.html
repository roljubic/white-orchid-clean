    <h1>How Cleanliness Scores Affect Your Airbnb Ranking in Hawaii</h1>
    <div class="meta">February 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; 8 min read</div>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Most Oahu Airbnb hosts focus on photography, pricing, and listing copy when trying to improve performance. Those things matter — but they're secondary to the score that has the most direct relationship with your search ranking, conversion rate, and Superhost eligibility: <strong>cleanliness</strong>.</p>

    <p>Airbnb doesn't publish its full algorithm, but years of host data and case studies make the relationship clear. Your cleanliness score is the metric with the highest variance across listings, the most direct driver of negative reviews, and one of the most controllable factors in your overall performance. Here's how it works.</p>

    <div class="stat-box">
      <div class="stat"><span class="number">4.8</span><span class="label">Minimum cleanliness score for Superhost status</span></div>
      <div class="stat"><span class="number">#1</span><span class="label">Category guests cite most in negative reviews</span></div>
      <div class="stat"><span class="number">~23%</span><span class="label">Estimated search rank improvement when cleanliness rises from 4.6 → 4.9</span></div>
    </div>

    <h2>How Airbnb's Algorithm Uses Cleanliness Scores</h2>
    <p>Airbnb's search ranking algorithm weighs multiple signals: price, availability, response rate, booking acceptance rate, review quality, and individual sub-scores (cleanliness, accuracy, communication, location, check-in, value). Cleanliness is weighted heavily for a simple reason: it's the most consistent predictor of whether a guest will leave a negative review.</p>

    <h3>The compounding effect of a low cleanliness score:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lower overall star rating</strong> — a 4.6 cleanliness score drags your overall rating below the Superhost threshold even if every other category is 5.0</li>
      <li><strong>Search rank suppression</strong> — Airbnb's algorithm deprioritizes listings that guests have flagged as clean concerns; it protects its own conversion rate by showing guests properties likely to deliver a good experience</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced conversion</strong> — guests reading reviews on your listing see cleanliness mentions. A single "hair on the pillow" comment can cost you 3–5 bookings before you fix the underlying issue</li>
      <li><strong>Superhost ineligibility</strong> — Superhost status requires a 4.8+ overall rating and contributes to a "Superhost" badge that meaningfully increases click-through and booking rates</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What the Scores Actually Mean: A Practical Scale</h2>

    <div class="score-bar">
      <div class="score-row">
        <div class="score-label">5.0</div>
        <div class="score-track"><div class="score-fill s98">Guest delighted — actively mentions cleanliness positively</div></div>
      </div>
      <div class="score-row">
        <div class="score-label">4.9</div>
        <div class="score-track"><div class="score-fill s93">Excellent — Superhost range, strong search visibility</div></div>
      </div>
      <div class="score-row">
        <div class="score-label">4.8</div>
        <div class="score-track"><div class="score-fill s85" style="color:#333">Acceptable — Superhost minimum threshold</div></div>
      </div>
      <div class="score-row">
        <div class="score-label">4.6</div>
        <div class="score-track"><div class="score-fill s70">Problem — search suppression begins, Superhost lost</div></div>
      </div>
      <div class="score-row">
        <div class="score-label">4.3</div>
        <div class="score-track"><div class="score-fill s50">Critical — guests actively warning others in reviews</div></div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>"On a 5-star scale, the difference between a 4.7 and a 4.9 cleanliness score feels small. In practice, it's the difference between Superhost status and not — and Superhost properties receive 22% more bookings on average, per Airbnb's own data."</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Hawaii-Specific Cleanliness Challenges</h2>
    <p>Oahu's environment creates cleaning challenges that don't exist in most vacation rental markets. These are the ones that cause the most score damage:</p>

    <h3>Humidity and mold</h3>
    <p>Hawaii's year-round humidity accelerates mold growth in bathrooms, closets, and any area with poor air circulation. A bathroom that was spotless two weeks ago can develop visible mildew in the grout by the time the next guests arrive. Proactive treatment — anti-mold sprays, grout sealing, regular ventilation checks — is essential. Reactive cleaning just removes the symptoms temporarily.</p>

    <h3>Sand infiltration</h3>
    <p>Beach guests bring sand. It goes everywhere — under furniture, into corners, inside shoes left by the door, into the grooves of sliding door tracks. A standard mop misses most of it. Guests from non-beach markets notice sand in ways they wouldn't at home; it reads as careless.</p>

    <h3>Hard water deposits</h3>
    <p>Oahu municipal water leaves mineral deposits on glass shower doors, faucets, and fixtures within days of cleaning. A squeegee protocol after every shower (by cleaners after each turnover) is the only maintenance solution. Calcium deposits that build up over multiple turnovers require acid-based cleaners and significantly more labor to remove.</p>

    <h3>Salt air oxidation</h3>
    <p>Salt air accelerates corrosion on metal fixtures, outdoor furniture, and appliances. Hardware that looks fine inside looks oxidized and dirty outside within weeks. Outdoor spaces — lanais, pool areas — require more frequent attention on Oahu than in any mainland climate.</p>

    <h2>The Recovery Playbook: Raising a Damaged Score</h2>
    <p>If your cleanliness score has dropped below 4.8, here's the path back:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Read every review that mentioned cleanliness</strong> — identify the specific recurring complaints. "Hair in bathroom" and "sand on floor" and "smelled musty" are different root causes requiring different fixes.</li>
      <li><strong>Do a deep clean before your next booking</strong> — not a turnover clean, a full deep clean: grout scrubbing, appliance interiors, under furniture, light fixtures, ceiling fan blades, window tracks. Start from zero.</li>
      <li><strong>Revise your cleaning protocol</strong> — add explicit checklist items for the specific failures. If it's not on the checklist, it won't get done consistently.</li>
      <li><strong>Add a personal inspection step</strong> — a dedicated 15-minute quality check after the cleaning and before check-in catches what cleaners miss. This is ideally done by someone other than the cleaner.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor for 3–4 turnovers</strong> — score recovery takes time since reviews accumulate. Don't change cleaners or protocols again mid-recovery; get consistent results first, then evaluate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Professional Advantage on Oahu</h2>
    <p>Professional vacation rental cleaning services that specialize in Oahu properties bring three things that individual cleaners typically can't: documented protocols calibrated to Hawaii's specific environment, quality inspection steps built into every turnover, and accountability backed by the cleaning service's own reputation.</p>

    <p>When a professional cleaner's business depends on their clients' Airbnb scores, the incentive alignment is different than a cleaner who simply gets paid per job. One bad review doesn't just affect your revenue — it affects theirs too.</p>

    <p>For Oahu vacation rental owners managing remotely, professional cleaning isn't an upgrade — it's the only reliable path to consistently 4.9+ cleanliness scores without being on-island to inspect every turnover yourself.</p>
